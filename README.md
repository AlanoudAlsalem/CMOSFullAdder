## Project Description
This project involved designing and successfully simulating a full adder circuit layout on the Glade software. The steps taken to achieve this outcome involved:
### 1. Designing the CMOS circuitry for each of the logic gates:

</br>

### 3. Creating the layout of each individual logic gate:

</br>

### 4. Combining all elements to design the full adder:

The DRC, LVS, and LPE were implemented to ensure proper functionality. 

The full adder layout, schematic, and cdl files are available.
